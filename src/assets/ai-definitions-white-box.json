                "definition": "This category encompasses methods that create interpretable and easily understandable from humans models. The models in this category are often called intrinsic, transparent, or white-box models. Such models include the linear, decision tree, and rule-based models and some other more complex and sophisticated models that are equally transparent and, therefore, promising for the interpretability field."
