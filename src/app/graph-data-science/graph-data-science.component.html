      <h3>What is Graph Data Science?</h3>

      <p>Graph Data Science is a science-driven approach to gain knowledge from the relationships and structures in data,
        typically to power predictions. It covers methods, techniques, algorithms and tools that help data scientists
        answer questions and explain outcomes using graph data.</p>

      <h3>How are graphs used in data science?</h3>

      <p>A graph is an abstract data type that requires two basic building blocks: nodes and vertices. A graph utilises
        the basic idea of using vertices to establish relationships between pairs of nodes. In terms of applications, many
        real world relationships are best modeled using graph structures.</p>

      In this section we will cover two popular graph models, namely RDF graphs and property graphs.

      <h3>RDF graph</h3>

      <p>An RDF graph is data structured according to the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/#section-triple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model.</a>
        A semantic triple, or RDF triple or simply triple, is the atomic data entity in the RDF data model. As its name
        indicates, a triple is a set of three entities that codifies a statement about semantic data in the form of
        subject–predicate–object expressions (e.g., "Bob is 35", or "Bob knows John").</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.linkeddatatools.com/introducing-rdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedDataTools RDF tutorial</a> gives further
        details and examples of RDF graphs. See <a
          href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/rdf+store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/rdf+store</a> for a list of
        databases that support RDF.</p>

      <h4>Example</h4>

      <h3>Property graph</h3>

      <p>A property graph or labeled property graph (LPG) are much simpler than RDF. They consist of a set of nodes and a
        set of edges, with each node and edge being essentially a struct, or a simple data structure, consisting of keys
        and values. JSON is a standard way of encoding these structs. Each node and edge is a JSON document, with edges
        having special keys with values pointing to a node. Nodes can be labelled to be grouped.</p>

      <p>According to <a
          href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/graph+dbms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/graph+dbms</a>, Neo4j
        ranks as the most popular graph database.
      <p>For further details on property graphs and examples please consult the <a
          href="https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/current/graphdb-concepts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neo4j graph database concepts</a>.</p>

      <h3>Research challenges and opportunities</h3>

      <p>The paper <a href="http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/content/role-knowledge-graphs-explainable-ai-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"On The
          Role of Knowledge Graphs in Explainable AI"</a> by F. Leccue reviews explainable AI (XAI) and presents
        limitations and opportunities for Knowledge Graphs and their underlying technologies within different fields of
        AI. Below we present the identified opportunites described in the paper
        for each of these fields:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Machine Learning (ML):</b> "Knowledge Graphs do encode con-texts, do expose connections and relations, and
          support inference and causation natively. Existing XAI approaches in ML consider a flat representation of data,
          and context is out of the loop of the explanation process. Knowledge Graphs could be used for encoding better
          representations of data, structuring an ML model in a more interpretable way, adopt semantic similarity for
          local explanation."</li>
        <li><b>Artificial (Deep) Neural Networks:</b> "Novel Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures need to be
          designed to natively encode explanation. Some recent approaches which aim at capturing better model
          hierarchical relationships, or causality mechanism are promising. However, they could be polished
          further by (i) adding logic representation layers in ANN, such as using network dissection approaches, (ii)
          encoding the semantics of inputs, outputs and their properties. Knowledge Graphs could play a central role in
          such a new design, particularly as novel architectures should embed causation and feature
          reasoning."</li>
        <li><b>Computer Vision:</b> "Adding semantics through context andKnowledge Graphs could help answering open
          questions, such as: What is a disentangled representation,and how can its factors be quantified and detected?
          Do interpretable hidden units reflect a special alignment offeature space, or are interpretations a chimera?
          (...) What conditions in state-of-the-art training lead to representations with greater or lesser entanglement?
          What is the semantics of a groupof hidden units in neural networks?"</li>
        <li><b>Constraint Satisfaction and Search:</b> "It has been demonstrated that anystructure in problem
          representation has largely benefited search. We could envision more knowledge-driven structure, inspired
          from Knowledge Graphs, which could dynamically adapt to variables, constraints, search space. Knowledge Graphs
          could evendrive search through semantic and logical relations among constraints, which could be modelled as
          entities in a graph."</li>
        <li><b>Game Theory:</b> "As recently explored, structured representation of the models as its features has
          shown better scalability, while not necessarily improving explainability. Knowledge Graphs could be considered
          to better structure models, organize features, then reducing the search space and potentially improve
          understanding and readability of explanation, particularly when embedded in a structured set of connected
          entities."</li>
        <li><b>Uncertainty in AI:</b> "Semantic representations and connections through Knowledge Graphs could be used to
          disambiguate and force latent variables to represent interpretable content."</li>
        <li><b>Robotics:</b> "The level of abstraction in explanation together with its multi-modal fusion are net
          opportunities for Knowledge Graphs. Some semantics could deeply support in exposing appropriate and
          personalized representations of explanations while fusing explanation content in a compact and
          comprehensible representation."</li>
        <li><b>Distributed AI:</b> "The dynamics of agents interaction should be captured more formally, and embedded
          with broader common sense knowledge to identify human interpretable explanation."</li>
        <li><b>Automatic Planning and Scheduling:</b> "Knowledge Graphs could be a way forward to better contextualize
          complex terms, and even better summarize complex actions in more succinct and meaningful way."</li>
        <li><b>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</b> "Semantic descriptions, exposing meaningful representations, have
          demonstrated to have apositive impact on tasks such as relation extraction, event extraction or
          text classification. Similar representations, inspired from Knowledge Graphs could provide the semantic
          layer missing from brute-force machine learning approaches ontext, aiming at exposing explanation."</li>
      </ul>
